## Procedure

⭐ When you enter the simulation section, a guided tour will appear. It is strongly recommended that you take the tour, as it provides step-by-step instructions to help you understand the experiment thoroughly. The tour also introduces you to the various controls, features, and interface elements, making it easier for you to navigate and explore the experiment effectively.


### Task-1: Photodiode Device Structure and Band Diagram Analysis

In the first task, the user is presented with the photodiode device structure visualization and corresponding band diagram plots. The simulation displays:
- Device cross-section showing P-N junction structure with depletion region
- Energy band diagram with conduction band, valence band, and Fermi level
- Two different bias conditions labeled "forward bias" and "reverse bias"
- Interactive photon absorption visualization with carrier generation

The user must identify and label each visualization with their respective operating conditions and explain the band bending effects under different bias voltages.

### Task-2: Interactive I-V Characteristics and Parameter Effects

In the second task, there are interactive plots showing photodiode I-V characteristics. The user can observe how different parameters affect the photodiode performance:
- **Bias Voltage Control**: Adjust from -5V to +5V to see forward and reverse bias behavior
- **Light Intensity Effects**: Vary incident light intensity from 0 to 100% to observe photocurrent generation
- **Temperature Dependence**: Modify temperature from 250K to 400K to study dark current variations
- **Doping Level Impact**: Change doping concentration to see junction properties

Real-time I-V curve updates allow users to understand the relationship between applied bias, photocurrent, and dark current components.

### Task-3: LED Operation and Emission Characteristics

In the third task, users explore LED (Light Emitting Diode) operation through:
- **Forward Bias Analysis**: Apply forward bias voltages and observe electroluminescence
- **Emission Spectrum**: Visualize photon emission with wavelength-dependent intensity
- **Carrier Injection**: Study electron-hole recombination mechanisms
- **Quantum Efficiency**: Calculate internal and external quantum efficiency values

Interactive controls allow adjustment of injection current, temperature, and material composition to understand LED performance optimization.

### Task-4: Solar Cell Performance and Power Generation

In the fourth task, the simulation demonstrates solar cell operation with:
- **Illumination Effects**: Vary solar irradiance to study short-circuit current changes
- **Load Line Analysis**: Interactive load resistance adjustment to find maximum power point
- **Fill Factor Calculation**: Determine solar cell efficiency parameters (Voc, Isc, Vmp, Imp)
- **Temperature Coefficient**: Observe how temperature affects solar cell performance

Users can analyze power-voltage curves and optimize operating conditions for maximum energy conversion efficiency.
