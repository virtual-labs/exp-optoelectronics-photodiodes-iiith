"question": "1. In a photodiode, which of the following conditions must be satisfied for photon absorption to occur?",
"answers": {
"a": "hν < Eg",
"b": "hν = 0",
"c": "hν ≥ Eg",
"d": "hν << Eg"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Photons with energy less than the bandgap cannot excite electrons.",
"b": "Incorrect. Zero photon energy implies no excitation.",
"c": "Correct. For photon absorption, the energy must be greater than or equal to the bandgap energy.",
"d": "Incorrect. If energy is much less than Eg, no carriers are generated."

},
{
"question": "2. What is the main purpose of reverse biasing a photodiode?",
"answers": {
"a": "To increase dark current",
"b": "To widen the depletion region and improve carrier collection",
"c": "To generate more photons",
"d": "To emit light"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Reverse bias doesn't aim to increase dark current.",
"b": "Correct. Reverse bias widens the depletion region, enhancing carrier separation and photocurrent.",
"c": "Incorrect. Photodiodes detect photons; they do not generate them.",
"d": "Incorrect. Light emission is related to LEDs, not photodiodes."

},
{
"question": "3. In an LED, radiative recombination occurs when:",
"answers": {
"a": "Electrons recombine with holes releasing phonons",
"b": "Electrons recombine with holes emitting photons",
"c": "Photons get absorbed by the depletion layer",
"d": "Carriers drift due to an external field only"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Phonon emission occurs in non-radiative recombination.",
"b": "Correct. In LEDs, photon emission results from radiative recombination.",
"c": "Incorrect. Photon absorption occurs in photodiodes, not LEDs.",
"d": "Incorrect. Drift is involved but not responsible for light generation."

"question": "4. If the quantum efficiency η of a photodiode is 0.6, Popt = 2 mW, and photon energy hν = 3.2 × 10⁻¹⁹ J, calculate the photocurrent Iph. Use q = 1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C.",

"b": "5.8 μA",
"c": "7.5 μA",
"d": "10.0 μA"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Use Iph = qηPopt/hν correctly.",
"b": "Correct. Substituting: Iph = (1.6e-19 × 0.6 × 2e-3) / (3.2e-19) ≈ 5.8 μA.",
"c": "Incorrect. Calculation mistake.",

"a": "3×10²³ s⁻¹",
"b": "1×10²³ s⁻¹",
"c": "2×10²³ s⁻¹",
"d": "5×10²³ s⁻¹"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. ηint = Rrad / (Rrad + Rnonrad). Solve carefully.",
"b": "Correct. Rearranging: Rnonrad = Rrad(1 - ηint)/ηint = 7e23(1-0.7)/0.7 ≈ 1×10²³ s⁻¹.",
"c": "Incorrect. Overestimated.",
"d": "Incorrect. Mismatch in substitution."

"a": "28.8%",
"b": "24.0%",
"c": "36.5%",
"d": "19.2%"

"a": "Correct. η = (Voc × Isc × FF) / Pin = (0.6×0.03×0.8)/0.05 ≈ 0.288 = 28.8%.",
"b": "Incorrect. Check formula again.",
"c": "Incorrect. Overestimation of η.",

"a": "1.38 eV",
"b": "1.55 eV",
"c": "1.2 eV",

"a": "Correct. Eg ≈ hc/(λq) ≈ (6.626e-34×3e8)/(900e-9×1.6e-19) ≈ 1.38 eV.",
"b": "Incorrect. Overestimated Eg.",
"c": "Incorrect. Slight underestimation.",

"c": "Bandgap energy must exceed photon energy",
"d": "Quantum efficiency = 0"
},
"explanations": {
"a": "Incorrect. Below threshold, no lasing occurs.",
"b": "Correct. Stimulated emission requires population inversion (more electrons in the excited state than the ground state).",
"c": "Incorrect. Photon energy must be ≤ bandgap for emission.",
"d": "Incorrect. Zero quantum efficiency means no emission at all."
